# socketio-chat
Code for web chat workshop using socketio and node

## Setup
Before doing the workshop, make sure you have the following installed:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - the popular, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that we'll use for the server
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The coding environment we'll use in the lab, although if you prefer another one, you can use that.

If you're working on the lab in the School, then we'll already have these installed.

## The workshop
In this workshop, you're going to build a web app that allows users to chat in real time, like the one shown below. Weâ€™ll use the same techniques as sites like discord, Twitter, and WhatsApp. This workshop is from a lab on the Dynamic Web
Development module. 

A guide for how to do this will be provided during the workshop. If you'd like a copy of this, [get in touch with David](https://rgu-repository.worktribe.com/person/173332/david-corsar)
